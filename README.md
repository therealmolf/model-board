# Model Board
A streamlit application of different models I have implemented to showcase my ability to use various ML tools.

---
# Tasks
- [X] Basic Tensors
- [X] Model Training with PyTorch 
- [X] Basic MLP on Dry Bean Dataset on Streamlit
- [ ] Find another cute dataset


# Getting Started
The streamlit application has not been deployed. Hence, you will have to locally clone the repo!
```shell
git clone https://github.com/therealmolf/model-board.git
```

Create a virtual environment.

Install the necessary packages.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application.
```shell
streamlit run src/Home.py
```
